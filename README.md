# PBI-Global-Superstore-Sales-Analysis
## I. Introduction
This project utilizes the Superstore company's sales data to analyze the company's business performance in order to develop market expansion strategies and make strategic product selection decisions. The business analysis by product and market will highlight potential products and markets. This Power BI project provides a visual perspective, supporting data-driven decision-making for the development of effective strategies.

## II. Dataset

The dataset contains global sales information for a company called Superstore, and includes three tables:
- **Orders:** A table that stores transaction information.
- **People:** A table that holds information about salespeople in different regions.
- **Returns:** A table that records transactions that were returned.

**1. Overview**

<img width="641" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffac9396-626f-409c-a3b4-371ccac657e3" />

**Insight:**
- Sales and Profit have grown steadily, doubling from 2011 to 2014. However, ROS declined slightly from 11.95% in 2013 to 11.37% in 2014.
- The Consumer segment leads in revenue ($6.51M, ~50%), while Home Office is the most profitable per unit ($11.99). The return rate decreased from 6.1% (2011) to 5.72% (2014), with Corporate having the highest rate (6.29%).
- Standard Class shipping dominates (60%), while high-value products like Cisco TelePresence ($23K AOV) drive premium sales. Despite strong growth, cost control and return management remain key areas for improvement.

**2. Product**

<img width="633" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79c7e2cc-762f-4bf1-9560-bb16fe4c9bd8" />


**Insight:**
- Sales and Profit continue to grow, reaching $1.5M profit in 2014, with Office Supplies contributing the most (60.78%). However, Furniture and Technology have higher return rates (~20%), affecting profitability.
- The top profitable products include Canon ($18K), Motorola ($17K), and Cisco ($16K), while Canon, Samsung, and Hoover lead in lost profit due to returns. Copiers generate the highest profit ($260K), whereas Tables show a loss (-$60K).
- The return rate dropped from 6.1% (2011) to 5.72% (2014), suggesting quality improvements. Paper, Labels, and Envelopes have the highest ROS (~24%), indicating strong profitability in these subcategories.
- Despite growth, reducing returns in high-value categories and addressing losses in low-performing subcategories remain key areas for improvement.

**3. Market**

<img width="635" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/195c1685-6527-43ef-b6fb-5bf016804f69" />


**Insight:**
- Sales reached $11.82M, with a total profit of $1.35M and an ROS of 11.41%. The U.S. led in sales ($2.12M) and profit ($263K), while LATAM contributed $205K in profit.
- Profit growth was strongest in Canada (+170%) and Africa (+124%), while the EU and LATAM saw moderate increases (~36%). APAC and the U.S. had the lowest growth (~24%).
- Return rates were highest in the EU (8.02%) and LATAM (8.01%), impacting overall profitability. Despite this, profit per unit remained highest in the EU ($12.69).
- To optimize growth, expanding in high-growth markets (Canada, Africa) while reducing return rates in LATAM and the EU should be prioritized.
