# PBI-Global-Superstore-Sales-Analysis
## I. Introduction
This project utilizes the Superstore company's sales data to analyze the company's business performance in order to develop market expansion strategies and make strategic product selection decisions. The business analysis by product and market will highlight potential products and markets. This Power BI project provides a visual perspective, supporting data-driven decision-making for the development of effective strategies.

**PRODUCT**
- **Home Supplies** accounts for the largest proportion of product volume, at 61.01%.
- **Paper** has the highest ROS, reaching 26.29%, but its order volume is only average, with 3.8K orders over 4 years.
- **Tables** are currently unprofitable, with a total loss of $31K over 4 years.
- **Canon ImageCLASS2000** is the most profitable product during 2013â€“2014, generating $9.0K in profit. However, it also has a high return volume, amounting to $6.7K.
